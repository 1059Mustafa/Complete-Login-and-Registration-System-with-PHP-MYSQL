there  are hell lot of bugs in this image upload 
==> the reason is we are not saving the images inour database, but in a specific folder so due to this 
--> the CRUD (create, read, update, delete ) application becomes very hard to handel


---> next time TASK IS TO COMPRESS THE IMAGE THEN put THIS IMAGE into the DATABASE...
